### What is a Markup-Language?

A mark-up language is different than a programming language. It doesn't have any programming logic or code that is executed to perform some action. It just allows you to annotate the text in the document to provide extra meaning to the content. The browser uses the annotations to know how to display the page.

> In computer text processing, a markup language is **a system for annotating a document in a way that is visually distinguishable from the content**. It is used only to format the text, so that when the document is processed for display, the markup language does not appear. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. - _Wikipedia_
