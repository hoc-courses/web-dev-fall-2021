# Common HTML Elements

There are lots of different markup elements: too many to list here. There's a small set that you will use very frequently and then some more obscure ones that you will use for specialized situations. The elements, and their attributes are not something that you need to memorize. You learn to use them as you need them and can always consult the online documentation.

These are the most common:

* [text-formatting](text-formatting-elemetns.md) (headings, ordered/unordered lists, emphasizing text, pull quotes, paragraph, etc.)
* [image](images.md)
* [hyper-links](links.md) (anchors) 
* [videos](video.md)
* [forms](forms.md)
* [tables](tables.md)
