# Typography

## What is Typography?

> In essence, _typography_ is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader.

## Typeface vs Font

A typeface is a family of related fonts, while fonts refer to the weights, widths, and styles that constitute a typeface.

There are three basic kinds of typeface: serif, sans-serif, and decorative (cursive, fantasy, monospace).

## Serif and Sans Serif

The two most commonly used typefaces are Serif and Sans Serif.

**Serif** - employ little extra ligatures on the letterforms. Those extra pieces are called _serifs_. Common serif fonts are Georgia and Times New Roman. Serif fonts work great for large text like heading as well as long passages of text and body copy.

**Sans-serif** - do not have ligatures. The name means _without serifs_. Popular fonts in this category include Arial or Helvetica. Similar to serifs, sans-serif fonts perform equally well in headings as well as body content, although some experts prefer that large blocks of text avoid sans-serif fonts because they're harder to read at small point sizes.

## Web Safe Fonts

In order for a typeface to show on a web page, a visitor must have access to that typeface on their computer. The easiest way to access a typeface is if it's already installed on the computer.

Most people don't ever intentionally install typefaces on their computers. Instead, they simply rely on the typefaces that get installed with the operating system and other software.

After comparing typefaces across different operating systems and common software packages, you are left with a very small subset of typefaces, referred to as **web safe fonts**. These are typefaces that you can be reasonably sure are installed on all computers.

What happens if we ask for a font that the user doesn't have? The font doesn't display. A different font is used instead (usually chosen by the browser).

## Font Stacks

A font stack is a set of fonts that are specified in order of desirability, so that the browser can use the first font available in the list.

## Font Embedding Services

Font embedding services host the typefaces on their sites and allow you to link to them. Google host a service that has free fonts and is very popular.
