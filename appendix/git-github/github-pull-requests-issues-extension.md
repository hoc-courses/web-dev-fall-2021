# GitHub Pull Requests/Issues Extension

This extension allows us to see our list of issues within VS Code.

### Install GitHub Pull Request & Issues Extension

### Turn Off Creation of New Branch for Working on an Issue

A typical workflow for working on an issue is to create a new branch to work on the issue, but we're not ready to introduce Git branching yet, so we're going to stick to working on issues in the main branch. There is a setting that we need to toggle to change the default behavior that creates a new branch when you click the issue in the VS Code Issues list to not create a new branch.

* Bring up configuration settings for the extension
  * File => Preferences => Settings
* Toggle the GitHub Issues: Use Branch for Issues: NO
