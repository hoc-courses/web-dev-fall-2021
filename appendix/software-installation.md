# Software Installation

We need to install several software applications, as well as create accounts on some of the websites that we will need to build our software projects. It is important that you complete the following work before you come to the first class.

## 1. Software Installation

### Git - Track Changes to Files

**Git** is software which allows you to track changes to a collection of files over time. The collection of files is called a repository, or repo. The repo is stored on your local computer. You need to install the Git software on your local computer to create repositories.

Go to the [git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download and install the version appropriate for your computer.

### GitHub - Collaboratively Build Software

**GitHub** is a cloud-based website that allows you to store your git repositories in the cloud so that they are backed up. Storing your repositories in the cloud also allows teams to collaboratively work on shared projects. You need to have an account on GitHub to be able to store your repositories there.

Go to the[ GitHub website](https://github.com) and click the sign-up button in the upper-right corner of the screen.

### Visual Studio Code - Source Code Editor

**VS Studio Code** is a source-code editor made by Microsoft. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, etc. It is free, and is very popular, in large part because of the large number of extensions (plug-ins) available that extend the functionality.

* go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download and install the appropriate version for your computer.
* if this is your first time using Visual Studio code, watch this introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE).
* install the **essential extensions** listed in the [VS Code Intro](broken-reference) topic.

### Chrome - Best Web Browser for Web Developers

Chrome provide a very rich toolset for inspecting and debugging web applications known as Chrome Developer Tools. You will want to make sure you have Chrome installed on your computer and configured to be your default browser.

If you don't already have Chrome installed on your computer, go to the [Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=WHAR\&geo=US\&gclid=Cj0KCQjwraqHBhDsARIsAKuGZeGcmK8qkC60-n1KsSQHKXKfHwM3SiIJQakSc-4LwMpnIFyoOEbRnAwaAmcqEALw_wcB\&gclsrc=aw.ds) and download and install Chrome.

### Node.js - Web-server Development

Node.js isn't needed until later in the course, but it's good install it early, just to make sure your computer is capable of running the latest version.

Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install Node.js.

### Slack - Team Communications

Slack is an application that allows team members to communicate with each other through chat, with optional phone/video. It's used in most tech companies and is really easy to use. We will use slack for our class communication.

Go to the [Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads/) and download and install Slack.

**Note:** If you want to use Slack from your phone, there's an app for that.
