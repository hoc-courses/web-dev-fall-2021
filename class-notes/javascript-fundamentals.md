### Forking

#### Contributing to Open-source Projects

Forking is a mechanism primarily used to contribute to an open-source repository that you are not a collaborator on. A collaborator has to be added by a repository admin, and it give the ability for the user to clone and push changes to the repo. 

On an open-source project, there are core group of collaborators, but anyone outside of that group must fork, or create a copy of the repository, under their own account. They can then clone their copy to their local computer and work on the code in any way they want. 

If they decide they want to contribute some changes back to the original repo, there is a mechanism built-in to the forking process to do that. The contributor just creates a pull request to the original repo and the collaborators on the original repo can then review and decide whether to accept the changes.

The user that forked the repository can also fetch updates from the source repo so that he can stay in sync.

#### Copying a Repo for Your Own Use

In some cases, like for our class, we just want to use the fork process to get a local copy of a repository so that we can work on it and push it to our local copy. In a class scenario, we can't all be collaborators and push our own solutions to the exercises to the same repo. 

GitHub introduced a new feature in 2019, called [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), which is similar to forking, but just creates a copy, without any of the history, or links to the original repo. That's what we'll be used for this assignment.

Click on the following link to go to the repository for this assignment

Click on the **Use this template** button. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Clone the repo from your account as you normally do and load the VS Code project.
